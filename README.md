# Greenest-Part
This is a simple map-reduce prorgam that essentially classifies areas into two categories- green and non green depending on their percentage of greenery. This program expects a dataset of the format <area_name.png>,<area_name>,<percentage>
The output will be as follows ('G',some_number), ('C',some_number). The total number of areas that are greeen is the number in the 'G' tuple.
